/**
 * Where an ACP agent's models and their credentials actually come from.
 *
 * The picker's model list is the agent's, and so are the API keys behind it:
 * each agent keeps its own config file and its own login. Termany's model
 * settings configure Chat mode and are deliberately kept out of an agent's
 * environment (see agentCredentials.ts on the server), so there is nothing here
 * for Termany to store — only somewhere to point.
 *
 * Only paths and commands verified against the shipped CLIs are listed; an
 * agent missing from here gets the explanation without an invented answer.
