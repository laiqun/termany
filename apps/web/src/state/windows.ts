/**
 * Multi-window plumbing.
 *
 * Every window renders the same shared record — workspaces, pages, tabs and
 * panes all live in the server's SQLite and reach the other windows over the
 * state stream (see sync.ts). Several windows can sit in the same workspace;
 * that's the point, since it's what lets one project spread across monitors.
 * What is NOT shared is where each window is looking, so the active workspace
 * and its page are kept in localStorage under the window's label.
 *
 * PAGES are exclusive, one window at a time. A page owns live terminals, and
 * the PTY server keeps exactly one socket per pane (it closes the previous on
 * reattach), so two windows on one page would fight over every shell in it —
 * and a browser pane is a native child webview, which belongs to exactly one
 * window by construction. The Rust side owns the window → page map; asking for
 * a page another window holds raises that window instead of switching.
 *
 * All of this degrades to a single window in a plain browser, where there are
 * no Tauri windows to coordinate.
