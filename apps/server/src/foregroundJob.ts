/**
 * The PTY's foreground process group: the signal iTerm2 reads to put a job
 * name on a tab, and the only one that answers "is something still running?"
 * without reading the screen. node-pty surfaces it as `IPty.process`, which
 * resolves tcgetpgrp() on the master fd to a process name.
 *
 * It cannot say *what* is running. Claude Code reports as "2.1.220" here,
 * because a version string is what it sets its process title to. So nothing
 * in this module tries to recognize an agent; the only comparison worth
 * making is against the name the session's own shell answers to, and
 * everything else is simply "a job".
 *
 * Two shapes report a job that never moves, and both have to stay harmless:
 * Windows conpty reports the shell for the life of the session, and an ssh
 * session's local foreground job is `ssh` no matter what runs at the far end.
 * Callers must therefore act on the away-and-back transition rather than on
 * the standing value, so that a job which never leaves the shell concludes
 * nothing at all.
