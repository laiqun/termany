/**
 * Keep agent conversations on the subscription the agent CLI is already logged
 * into.
 *
 * The Claude and Codex ACP adapters both prefer a credential from the
 * environment over their CLI's stored login, and neither asks first — the
 * `claude` CLI prompts once before honouring an ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, but the SDK
 * the adapter is built on just uses it. So a single `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
 * in ~/.zshrc silently moves every conversation onto per-token billing, which
 * surfaces as an opaque "Credit balance is too low" rather than as a choice the
 * user made.
 *
 * A terminal pane is the user's own shell and keeps whatever they export there.
 * A Termany conversation is ours, and it stays predictable: one agent, one
 * account, the one they logged into.
