/**
 * The shell-exit wire protocol, end to end against a real server and a real PTY.
 *
 * The frontend decides whether a dead shell should take its pane with it (see
 * apps/web/src/terminal/shellExit.ts). That decision is only as good as the exit
 * status reaching it, and the status travels on the WebSocket CLOSE frame — a
 * path no unit test covers, since it involves node-pty, the ws server, and the
 * browser's CloseEvent semantics all agreeing.
 *
 * Runs the server under a throwaway HOME so it never touches ~/.termany.
